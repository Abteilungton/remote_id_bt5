# Remote ID

A program for the nRF52840 that transmits opendroneid / ASTM F3411 / ASD-STAN 4709-002 UAV direct remote identification signals over Bluetooth 4 & 5 LR. 

This was my first significant program using Zephyr. It may be my last :-).

## Getting Started

### Build System

This program uses the nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr.
